# Functions in php
  * Function is a piece of code in a programming .which is takes one more input in the form of parameters and does some processing and returns a value.
  * It has two methods -> 1. creating a php functions
                          2. calling a php functions

It is very easy to create a new function
  It has some protocals like 
    1.Before the function name the function keyword  (**function) must be present , then only the php know this code is a function
    2.After the created funtion name must have { ...} braces . Everything should be present inside the curly braces ...
    3.After that we need the call the function using that function name with parentheses ();
    
    
Next, Passing parameter in funciton 
  It should be  entering the parameters inside the funtion () parentheses. 
  eg : function addnumbers ($num1,$num2){..
                      ...}
                      addnumbers( 20,39); --> this method is called the passing parameters
