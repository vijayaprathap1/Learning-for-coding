# Array
  Array is the collection of items stored in a contigious memory location . The idea is to store the multiple data in a same type.
  It can be easier to calculate the position of each value by simply adding the offset to the base value ( the memory location of the first element of the array) .
  
  I got the [link for array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arrays-in-c-cpp/)
  
# Why we need arrays ?  
  we can use normal variable to store data like ( v1, v2 v3) when we want the small number of value , but if we want the store a large number of instances, 
  It becomes difficult to manage  the normal variables..Thats why we go for array.
  The main idea of the array is many instances in one variable..
  
# [Declaration of array here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arrays-in-c-cpp/) 
     
    Array declaration by specifying size
    Array declaration by initializing elements
    Array declaration by specifying size and initializing elements
    
# Advantages of array 
  * Random access of elements using array index
  * it uses less line of code it create single array of multiple instances
  
# Disadvantages of array
  * Array is static fixed number of elements only storing the variable , which is decided at the time of declaration
  unlike **Linked list** , array is not a dynamic
  
  * insertion and deletion is most costly since the element to be managed in accordance to new memory allocation
